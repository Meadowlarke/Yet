# The Garden

You awake in a garden. You weren't aware that you had been sleeping, but you're definately here now... wherever "here" is. You sit up from the woven straw mat and look around. There is a well in the middle of the garden, with flowers and fuit trees all around. To the northest there is a cottage. You walk to the well and draw yourself a drink of water. 

You notice someone comming toward you. 

They are wearing a long black robe with a hood. There is a round miror where you expect the face to be.

Suprisingly, you don't feel frightened.

"I wasn't expecting anyone today."

You don't know how to respond to this.

"Have a sandwich."

You being to politely decline but before you know it there is a sandwhich in your hand.

"Please."

You take a bite. It's delicious. 

"To the north is the river, cross it at the bridge and continue north to the Library in a Rock. If you turn west before the bridge you can follow the river down to the coast. Follow the river east to its source in the mountains and you will find the overlook. South of here is the desert."

The gardener pauses and you nod.

"When you are ready to leave, come see my in my cottage."

You thank the garder for the food and the directions. They nod and dissapear among the flowers and fruit trees.
