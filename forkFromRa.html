<p>You climb the bluff and follow the river east.</p>
<p>You come to a place where the river is split in two by a big rock. To your surprise there is a frog sunning himself.</p>
<p>“Why hello there.” He croaks.</p>
<p>You try to respond but the words get stuck in your throat.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, it’s okay. I surprise everyone who comes this way.”</p>
<p>There is something familiar about him, but you can’t place it.</p>
<p>“Hi,” you are finally able to get out.</p>
<p>“I’ll bet your wondering where you are, too.” The frog continues.</p>
<p>He stands up on long spindly legs, gestures: “To the northwest is the Monae, and to the southwest is the Ra. They both go for some time before they end at the ocean.”</p>
<p>You thank him, and wish him a sunny day.</p>
