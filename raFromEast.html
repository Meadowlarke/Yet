# The mouth of the Ra

You follow the Ra southest for some time. You come to a bluff overlooking the ocean and find a way down. 

The coast is rocky and dotted with tidepools. Across the top of each pool you can make out the gohstly image of a different world.

You look closer.

You might be able to reach the mouth of the Monae by following the coast north.

To the south you can make out people and animals in the distance.
