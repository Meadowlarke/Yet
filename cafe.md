# The library cafe

The library cafe is in a cloister cut out of the side of the rock. The barista is pulling shots of what looks like ground up stone and cave water. You decide to pass on that delight for now. 

There are a number of odd characters conversing at a long table. They don't seem to mind you listening, so you take a seat.
