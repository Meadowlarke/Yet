# Fork in the river

You come to a place where the river is split in two by a big rock, downstream of a stone bridge. To your surprise there is a frog sunning himself.

"Why hello there."  He croaks.

You try to respond but the words get stuck in your throat.

"It's okay, it's okay. I surprise everyone who comes this way."

There is something familiar about him, but you can't place it.

"Hi," you are finally able to get out.

"I'll bet your wondering where you are, too." The frog continues.

He stands up on long spindly legs, gestures: "To the northwest is the Monae, and to the southwest is the Ra. They both go for some time before they end at the ocean. To the east there is another bridge to cross the river.

You thank him, and wish him a sunny day.
