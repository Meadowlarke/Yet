# The mouth of the Ra

The coast is rocky and dotted with tidepools. Across the top of each pool you can make out the ghostly image of a different world.

You look closer.

You might be able to reach the mouth of the Mon√°e by following the coast north.  

To the south you can make out people and animals in the distance.
