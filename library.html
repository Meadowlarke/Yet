<p>A towering rock in the middle of the rolling planes. A door has been carved out in the stone. An attendant waves you in to the cavern. It is lit by the by the glow of multicolored crystals. The attend warms her hands by an especially large orange crystal behind her desk.</p>
<p>“This is the Library in a Rock.”</p>
<p>“Truly…” you reply.</p>
<p>“The west wing is books, the east is journals. There’s a cafe upstairs.”</p>
