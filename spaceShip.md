# In the spaceship

You walk in through the sliding door in the front. The two rotors stare at you like a pair of eyes. Inside, the machine is cavernous. You walk to the bridge. Where you would expect controls to be there is an electric keyboard and other instruments.  

You notice a drawer full of navigational charts.
