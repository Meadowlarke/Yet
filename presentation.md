# Connecting dots into constellations: Sun Ra as historian


They say that history repeats itself, but history is only history. You havenâ€™t heard mystory yet. My story is different from his story. My story is not part of history, because history repeats itself, but my story is endless. It never repeats itself. Why should it? A sunset does not repeat itself. Neither does the sunrise. Nature never repeats itself. Why should I repeat myself?

[I, Pharaoh](https://youtu.be/p2qvSBeOcDA?t=169)  

  	Once I was in Egypt Land.  
		Once I was in ancient Egypt.  
		Once, once I was in ancient Egypt,  
		When the world was young.    
		
		There was always springtime in the air,  
		There was happiness everywhere.  
		I remember when I walked beside the Nile,  
		In Ancient Egypt.  
		
		I was Pharaoh then.  
		I am the Pharaoh who fed the world for seven years.  
		You've heard of me.  
		I fed the world, for seven years!  
		For seven years.        
		
		I did not discriminate.  
		I fed the rich,  
		I fed the poor,  
		I fed the wicked,  
		I fed the righteous,   
		I fed the good  
		I fed the evil!  
		
		I, pharaoh, fed everyone.  

		Every nation upon the Earth came to my [inaudible].  	
		I did not turn any of them away.  
		I fed everyone.  
		And Earth gives me no glory!  
		They never tell my side of the story!  
		The never give me glory.  
		
		They got a Mothers' Day,  
		They got a Fathers' Day,  
		They got a Labor Day,  
		They got a Christmas Day,  
		They got a Easter day,	  
		They got all kind of days!  
		They don't have a day for me...  
	
		They give me no glory! 	
		They'll never tell my story!  
		They don't give me no glory...  
		
		I fed your ancestors.  
		Where would you be if it wasn't for me!?  
		I, I fed a world.  
		They give me no glory,  
		They never tell my story.  
		
		
		My kingdom was splendor without compare.  
		You can by the treasures that are still there.  
		My kingdom was splendor, without compare!  
		You can tell by the treasures that are still there.  
		My kingdom was splendor, without compare!  
		You can tell by the treasures that are still there!  
		
		The nations of the world destroyed my kingdom,  
		Enslaved my people!  
		Destroyed my kingdom!  
		Enslaved my people!  
		Now I, Pharaoh, am all alone.  
		I have no kingdom, I have no people.  
		I have no kingdom, I have no people.  
		
		And yet my kingdom  
		of ancient Egypt was splendor  
		without compare,  
		you can tell  
		by the treasures  
		that are still there.  
		
		I'm all alone now.  
		I have no people now!  
		The nations of the world destroyed my kingdom,  
		Enslaved my people!  
		I am all alone now...  
		I have no kingdom now,  
		I have no people now!  
		Why don't you be my people now?  
		
		My kingdom was splendor without compare,  
		You can tell by the treasures that are still there.  
		I have no people now!  
		Why don't you be my people now?  
		I'm pharaoh of ancient Egypt  
		Why don't you be my people now!?  
		
		My kingdom was splendor without compare,  
		You can tell,  
		you can tell,  
		you can tell,  
		by the treasures that are still there.  
		you can tell by the treasures that are still there.  
		Why don't you be my people now?  
		Why don't you be my people now!?  
		I am all alone now!  
		
		They took my kingdom,  
		They took my people,  
		I have nothing left now.  
		
		Except one thing:  
		Let us bargain together, nations of Earth.  
		Let us bargain together, you nations of Earth.  
		Let us bargain together! I have one thing left:  
		The secret of immortality.  
		I have one thing left, nations of Earth!  
		The secret of immortality!  
		Behold me, pharaoh!
